Core Library 
============================================================
WARNING: This tutorial was written for Core 1*.
	There are some differences from Core 2*.

	Some useful documents related to Core Library.

	tutorial.pdf	-- The tutorial for Core Library. It was originally
			   written for Core 1*, but the basic interface and 
			   usage is still valid for the latest version of
			   Core Library.  An update is planned for Core 2*.

	zilinThesis.pdf	-- this is Zilin Du's PhD thesis in 2006
			   describing the new design of Core 2.0. 
			   Expressions became parametrized by three
			   modules (filter class, root-bound class and
			   number kernel class).  We introduced support for
			   transcendental functions and anary functions
			   such as sum and product.

	eclipse.txt	-- a basic introduction to using the eclipse IDE
			   with Core Library.
