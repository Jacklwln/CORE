READFIRST

There is a README file in $(CORE)/progs,
and also in most subdirectories of (CORE)/progs.

But if you browse the subdirectories through our download
pages, these files may not show up.  You can explicitly 
point your browser at the README file to get it:

E.g., for the README file in (CORE)/progs/, use

  http://cs.nyu.edu/exact/core/download/core_v2.0/core_v2.0/progs/README
